# Dlq Service

DLQ Service - a service to manage the dead letter queue for Kafka events

## Description

<!-- Please provide a short overview of the features of this service. -->

The DLQ Service provides a way to manage Kafka topics designated as dead letter queues
via a RESTful API interface.

The DLQ Service subscribes to the configured DLQ topic and saves all inbound events
to the database. Using the REST API to interact with a given service + topic,
events can be previewed, discarded, modified, and requeued for the original service
to re-consume them. When requeuing an event, the DLQ service publishes the event to
a Kafka "retry" topic, whose name is automatically derived from the service name
included in the event's DLQ information.


## Installation

We recommend using the provided Docker container.

A pre-built version is available at [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ghga/dlq-service):
```bash
docker pull ghga/dlq-service:3.0.0
```

Or you can build the container yourself from the [`./Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile):
```bash
# Execute in the repo's root dir:
docker build -t ghga/dlq-service:3.0.0 .
```

For production-ready deployment, we recommend using Kubernetes, however,
for simple use cases, you could execute the service using docker
on a single server:
```bash
# The entrypoint is preconfigured:
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghga/dlq-service:3.0.0 --help
```

If you prefer not to use containers, you may install the service from source:
```bash
# Execute in the repo's root dir:
pip install .

# To run the service:
dlqs --help
```

## Configuration

### Usage:

A template YAML for configuring the service can be found at
[`./example-config.yaml`](./example-config.yaml).
Please adapt it, rename it to `.dlqs.yaml`, and place it in one of the following locations:
- in the current working directory where you execute the service (on Linux: `./.dlqs.yaml`)
- in your home directory (on Linux: `~/.dlqs.yaml`)

The config yaml will be automatically parsed by the service.

**Important: If you are using containers, the locations refer to paths within the container.**

All parameters mentioned in the [`./example-config.yaml`](./example-config.yaml)
could also be set using environment variables or file secrets.

For naming the environment variables, just prefix the parameter name with `dlqs_`,
e.g. for the `host` set an environment variable named `dlqs_host`
(you may use both upper or lower cases, however, it is standard to define all env
variables in upper cases).

To use file secrets, please refer to the
[corresponding section](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/settings/#secret-support)
of the pydantic documentation.

## Development

For setting up the development environment, we rely on the
[devcontainer feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) of VS Code
in combination with Docker Compose.

To use it, you have to have Docker Compose as well as VS Code with its "Remote - Containers"
extension (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`) installed.
Then open this repository in VS Code and run the command
`Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` from the VS Code "Command Palette".

This will give you a full-fledged, pre-configured development environment including:
- infrastructural dependencies of the service (databases, etc.)
- all relevant VS Code extensions pre-installed
- pre-configured linting and auto-formatting
- a pre-configured debugger
- automatic license-header insertion

Moreover, inside the devcontainer, a command `dev_install` is available for convenience.
It installs the service with all development dependencies, and it installs pre-commit.

The installation is performed automatically when you build the devcontainer. However,
if you update dependencies in the [`./pyproject.toml`](./pyproject.toml) or the
[`./requirements-dev.txt`](./requirements-dev.txt), please run it again.
